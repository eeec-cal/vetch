Veeeery tiny fetch

Vetch is a little fetch script I made! It's tiny, fast, and looks good!

# How to get it
Vetch is on the AUR, so on Arch you just run:
```
yay -S vetch
```
Or:
```
paru -S vetch
```

# Configuration
At the moment, there are not a lot of config options, them being only compatible with kitty. There's only an image mode available at the moment, but I plan on adding more stuff in the future! :D
